# PHP-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen PHP assessment that requires the candidate to return the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The file to implement this in is `src/FibonacciCalculator.php`

The tests that are run are located in `tests/FibonacciCalculatorTest.php` and `tests/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.php`

The tests in `tests/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.php` are not visible to the candidate.

`PHP` version 7.2 must be used and the `PHPUnit` version in `composer.json` must not be changed.

Happy testing!

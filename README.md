# PHP-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen PHP assessment that requires the candidate to return the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be `0-indexed`, with `fibonacci(0)` returning 0 and `fibonacci(1)` returning 1.

The file to implement this in is [src/FibonacciCalculator.php](src/FibonacciCalculator.php).

The tests that are run are located in [tests/FibonacciCalculatorTest.php](tests/FibonacciCalculatorTest.php) and [tests/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.php](tests/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.php).

The tests in [tests/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.php](tests/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.php) are not visible to the candidate.

`PHP` version 8.0 must be used and the `PHPUnit` version in [composer.json](composer.json) must not be changed.

Happy testing!
